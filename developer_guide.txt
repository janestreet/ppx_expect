PPX EXPECT
==========

This directory contains the logic used by [ppx_expect] to:
- Expand [let%expect_test], [[%expect]], etc. extension points in
  files containing expect tests
- Report the results of these tests to the inline testing harness at
  runtime
- Rewrite failing tests as [.corrected] files

The layout of the subdirectories is summarized below:

ppx/ppx_expect
└── config: [Expect_test_config], containing default values for
│   │       overridable user-facing test configurations
│   └── types: [Expect_test_config_types], which defines the interface
│              for [Expect_test_config]
└── runtime: [Ppx_expect_runtime], containing the logic used to
│            evaluate expect tests at runtime
└── src: [Ppx_expect], the ppx rewriter that replaces [ppx_expect]
│        extensions with the appropriate logic from
│        [Ppx_expect_runtime]
└── test: [Ppx_expect_test], containing examples of passing expect
    │     tests that stress different facets of the testing framework,
    │     taken from the old [ppx_expect] framework
    └── example: [Expect_test_examples], with small examples
    └── no-output-patterns: [Ppx_expect_test_no_output_patterns],
                            additional tests used by the old
                            [ppx_expect] framework

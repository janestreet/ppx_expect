  (** Execute a single [let%expect_test] block through [Ppx_inline_test_lib.test].

      - Assert that the test is defined in the currently-executing file.
      - Generate two implicit [Test_node.t]s representing trailing output (expectation
        that there is none) and uncaught exception (expectation that there is none if
        [expected_exn = None], or else that the test raises with [expected_exn]).
      - Add the explicit [Test_node.t]s in [expectations] (those actually present in the
        test body), as well as the two implicit [Test_node.t]s described above, into the
        global table of [Test_node.t]s.
      - Run the callback and the tests for trailing output and uncaught exceptions,
        accumulating the results of each reached "expectation" inside the corresponding
        [Test_node.t].
      - After the callback finishes, if any of the expectations do not match, inform the
        inline testing harness that the test has "failed". *)

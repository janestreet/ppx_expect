module Expect_node_formatting : sig

module Compact_loc : sig
  (** A range of characters in a source file.

      Notably, [Compact_loc.t] does not store the name of the file itself; it only
      represents the range of characters.

      Consider this diagram, where the characters [/[a-b]/] represent the included range,
      and the characters [/[.0]/] represent the surrounding text:

      {v
      .......
      0.........a-----
      ------------
      -----b
      .........
      v}

      Then [start_bol] is the position of [0], [start_pos] of [a], and [end_pos] of [b].

      This record corresponds to a [Ppxlib.Location.t] restricted to just the
      [loc_start.pos_cbol], [loc_start.pos_cnum], and [loc_end.pos_cnum] fields. *)

      only to minimize external dependencies. *)
  val equal : t -> t -> bool

  (** Compares the range of characters spanned by a [Compact_loc.t]. Ranges that start
      earlier are considered smaller. For ranges that start at the same position, ranges
      that end earlier are considered smaller. *)

module Virtual_loc : sig
  (** Information that should be taken into account when inserting and formatting

      point or attribute ([[%expect]], [[%expect_exact]], [[%expect.unreachable]], or

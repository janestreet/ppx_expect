expect-test - a Cram-like framework for OCaml
=============================================


# Introduction

Expect-test is a framework for writing tests in OCaml, similar to
[Cram](https://bitheap.org/cram/).

Expect-tests mimic the (now less idiomatic)
[inline test](https://github.com/janestreet/ppx_inline_test)
framework in providing a
`let%expect_test` construct.

The body of an expect-test can contain output-generating code, interleaved with
`[%expect]` extension expressions to denote the expected output.

When run, expect-tests pass iff the output [_matches_](#matching-behavior) the expected
output. If a test fails, the `inline_tests_runner` outputs a diff and creates a file with
the suffix ".corrected" containing the actual output.

Here is an example expect-test in `foo.ml`:

<!-- $MDX file=./test/negative-tests/for-mdx/foo.ml,part=addition -->
```ocaml
open! Core

let%expect_test "addition" =
  printf "%d" (1 + 2);
  [%expect {| 4 |}]
;;
```

When the test runs, the `inline_tests_runner` creates `foo.ml.corrected` with contents:

<!-- $MDX file=./test/negative-tests/for-mdx/foo.ml.corrected.expected,part=addition -->
```ocaml
open! Core

let%expect_test "addition" =
  printf "%d" (1 + 2);
  [%expect {| 3 |}]
;;
```

`inline_tests_runner` also outputs:

<!-- $MDX file=./test/negative-tests/for-mdx/test-output.expected -->
```
------ foo.ml
++++++ foo.ml.corrected
File "foo.ml", line 6, characters 0-1:
 |open! Core
 |
 |let%expect_test "addition" =
 |  printf "%d" (1 + 2);
-|  [%expect {| 4 |}]
+|  [%expect {| 3 |}]
 |;;
 |
```

Diffs are shown in color if the `-use-color` flag is passed to the inline test runner
executable.

# Common usage

Each `[%expect]` block matches all the output generated since the previous `[%expect]`
block (or the beginning of the test). In this way, when multiple `[%expect]` blocks are
interleaved with test code, they can help show which part of the test produced which
output.

The following test:

<!-- $MDX file=./test/negative-tests/for-mdx/mdx_cases.ml,part=interleaved -->
```ocaml
let%expect_test "interleaved" =
  let l = [ "a"; "b"; "c" ] in
  printf "A list [l]\n";
  printf "It has length %d\n" (List.length l);
  [%expect {| A list [l] |}];
  List.iter l ~f:print_string;
  [%expect
    {|
    It has length 3
    abc
    |}]
;;
```

is rewritten as

<!-- $MDX file=./test/negative-tests/for-mdx/mdx_cases.ml.corrected.expected,part=interleaved -->
```ocaml
let%expect_test "interleaved" =
  let l = [ "a"; "b"; "c" ] in
  printf "A list [l]\n";
  printf "It has length %d\n" (List.length l);
  [%expect
    {|
    A list [l]
    It has length 3
    |}];
  List.iter l ~f:print_string;
  [%expect {| abc |}]
;;
```

When there is "trailing" output at the end of a `let%expect_test` (output that has yet to
be matched by some `[%expect]` block), a new `[%expect]` block is appended to the test
with the trailing output:

<!-- $MDX file=./test/negative-tests/for-mdx/mdx_cases.ml,part=trailing -->
```ocaml
let%expect_test "trailing output" =
  print_endline "Hello";
  [%expect {| Hello |}];
  print_endline "world"
;;
```

becomes:

<!-- $MDX file=./test/negative-tests/for-mdx/mdx_cases.ml.corrected.expected,part=trailing -->
```ocaml
let%expect_test "trailing output" =
  print_endline "Hello";
  [%expect {| Hello |}];
  print_endline "world";
  [%expect {| world |}]
;;
```

# Matching behavior

You might have noticed that the contents of the `[%expect]` blocks are not _exactly_ the
program output; in some of the examples above, they contain a different number of leading
and trailing newlines, and are indented to match the code indentation. We say the contents
of a block `[%expect str]` (where `str` is some string literal) _match_ the output at that
block if the output, after we format it to standardize indentation and other whitespace,
is identical to the contents of `str`
after it has been similarly formatted
.

The formatting applied depends on the type of delimiter used in `str` (i.e. whether it a
`"quoted string"` or a `{xxx| delimited string |xxx}`). To summarize:

* Output containing only whitespace is formatted as `[%expect {| |}]` or `[%expect ""]`.
* Output where only one line contains non-whitespace characters is formatted onto a single
  line, as `[%expect {| output |}]` or `[%expect "output"]`.
* Output where multiple lines contain non-whitespace characters is formatted so that:
  - There is no trailing whitespace on lines with content.
  - The relative indentation of the lines is preserved.
  - In `{| delimited strings |}`, the least-indented line with content (the "left margin"
    of the output) is aligned to be two spaces past the indentation of the `[%expect]`
    block.
  - In `"quoted string"`, the least-indented line is indented by exactly one space (this
    plays the nicest with `ocamlformat`'s existing decisions about how to format string
    literals).
  - There is one empty line before and one empty line after the contents.


Here is an example containing several cases of output that are subject to distinct
formatting rules and how they appear in `[%expect]` and `[%expect_exact]` blocks:

<!-- $MDX file=./test/negative-tests/for-mdx/mdx_cases.ml.corrected.expected,part=matching -->
```ocaml
let%expect_test "matching behavior --- no content" =
  printf "     ";
  [%expect {| |}];
  printf "     ";
  [%expect ""];
  printf "     ";
  [%expect_exact {|     |}];
  printf "     ";
  [%expect_exact "     "]
;;

let%expect_test "matching behavior --- one line of content" =
  printf "\n   This is one line\n\n";
  [%expect {| This is one line |}];
  printf "\n   This is one line\n\n";
  [%expect "This is one line"];
  printf "\n   This is one line\n\n";
  [%expect_exact
    {|
   This is one line

|}];
  printf "\n   This is one line\n\n";
  [%expect_exact "\n   This is one line\n\n"]
;;

let%expect_test "matching behavior --- multiple lines of content" =
  printf
    {|
Once upon a midnight dreary,
  while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious
  volume of forgotten lore |};
  [%expect
    {|
    Once upon a midnight dreary,
      while I pondered, weak and weary,
    Over many a quaint and curious
      volume of forgotten lore
    |}];
  printf
    {|
Once upon a midnight dreary,
  while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious
  volume of forgotten lore |};
  [%expect
    " \n\
    \ Once upon a midnight dreary,\n\
    \   while I pondered, weak and weary,\n\
    \ Over many a quaint and curious\n\
    \   volume of forgotten lore\n\
    \ "];
  printf
    {|
Once upon a midnight dreary,
  while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious
  volume of forgotten lore |};
  [%expect_exact
    {|
Once upon a midnight dreary,
  while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious
  volume of forgotten lore |}];
  printf
    {|
Once upon a midnight dreary,
  while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious
  volume of forgotten lore |};
  [%expect_exact
    "\n\
     Once upon a midnight dreary,\n\
    \  while I pondered, weak and weary,\n\
     Over many a quaint and curious\n\
    \  volume of forgotten lore "]
;;
```

Expect-test is by default permissive about this formatting, so that a
`[%expect]` block that is correct modulo formatting is
accepted. However, passing `-expect-test-strict-indentation=true` to
the ppx driver makes the test runner issue corrections for blocks that
do not satisfy the indentation rules.
For example, the following:

<!-- $MDX file=./test/negative-tests/for-mdx/mdx_cases.ml,part=bad-format -->
```ocaml
let%expect_test "bad formatting" =
  printf "a\n    b";
  [%expect
    {|
a
    b |}]
;;
```
is corrected to:

<!-- $MDX file=./test/negative-tests/for-mdx/mdx_cases.ml.corrected.expected,part=bad-format -->
```ocaml
let%expect_test "bad formatting" =
  printf "a\n    b";
  [%expect
    {|
    a
        b
    |}]
;;
```

(to add the required indentation and trailing newline)


# Reachability

## Expects reached from multiple places

A `[%expect]` extension can be encountered multiple times if it is in e.g. a functor or a
function:

<!-- $MDX file=./test/negative-tests/for-mdx/mdx_cases.ml,part=function -->
```ocaml
let%expect_test "function" =
  let f output =
    print_string output;
    [%expect {| hello world |}]
  in
  f "hello world";
  f "hello world"
;;
```

The test passes if the `[%expect]` block matches the output each time it is encountered,
as described in the section on [matching behavior](#matching-behavior).

If the outputs are not consistent, then the corrected file contains a report of all of the
outputs that were captured, in the order that they were captured at runtime.

For example, calling `f` in the snippet above with inconsistent arguments will produce:

<!-- $MDX file=./test/negative-tests/for-mdx/mdx_cases.ml.corrected.expected,part=broken-function -->
```ocaml
let%expect_test "function" =
  let f output =
    print_string output;
    [%expect
      {|
      (* expect_test: Test ran multiple times with different test outputs *)
      ============================ Output 1 / 4 ============================
      hello world
      ============================ Output 2 / 4 ============================
      goodbye world
      ============================ Output 3 / 4 ============================
      once upon
      a midnight dreary
      ============================ Output 4 / 4 ============================
      hello world
      |}]
  in
  f "hello world";
  f "goodbye world";
  f "once upon\na midnight dreary";
  f "hello world"
;;
```


## Unreached expects

Every `[%expect]` and `[%expect_exact]` block in a `let%expect_test` must be reached at
least once if that test is ever run. Failure for control flow to reach a block is _not_
treated like recording empty output at a block. The extension expression
`[%expect.unreachable]` is used to indicate that some part of an expect test shouldn't be
reached; if control flow reaches that point anyway, the corrected file replaces the
`[%expect.unreachable]` with a plain old expect containing the output collected until that
point. Conversely, if control flow never reaches some `[%expect]` block, that block is
turned into a `[%expect.unreachable]`. For example:

<!-- $MDX file=./test/negative-tests/for-mdx/mdx_cases.ml,part=unreachable -->
```ocaml
let%expect_test "unreachable" =
  let interesting_bool = 3 > 5 in
  printf "%b\n" interesting_bool;
  if interesting_bool
  then [%expect {| true |}]
  else (
    printf "don't reach\n";
    [%expect.unreachable])
;;
```
becomes:

<!-- $MDX file=./test/negative-tests/for-mdx/mdx_cases.ml.corrected.expected,part=unreachable -->
```ocaml
let%expect_test "unreachable" =
  let interesting_bool = 3 > 5 in
  printf "%b\n" interesting_bool;
  if interesting_bool
  then [%expect.unreachable]
  else (
    printf "don't reach\n";
    [%expect
      {|
      false
      don't reach
      |}])
;;
```

Note that, for an expect block that is sometimes reachable and sometimes not, that block
passes if the output captured at that block matches every time the block is encountered.
For example, the following test passes:

<!-- $MDX file=./test/negative-tests/for-mdx/mdx_cases.ml.corrected.expected,part=sometimes-reachable -->
```ocaml
module Test (B : sig
    val interesting_opt : int option
  end) =
struct
  let%expect_test "sometimes reachable" =
    match B.interesting_opt with
    | Some x ->
      printf "%d\n" x;
      [%expect {| 5 |}]
    | None -> [%expect {| |}]
  ;;
end

module _ = Test (struct
    let interesting_opt = Some 5
  end)

module _ = Test (struct
    let interesting_opt = None
  end)

module _ = Test (struct
    let interesting_opt = Some 5
  end)
```

# Exceptions

When an exception is raised by the body of an expect-test, the `inline_test_runner` shows
it (and, if relevant, any output generated by the test that had not yet been captured) in
a `[@@expect.uncaught_exn]` attribute attached to the corresponding `let%expect_test`.
`[%expect]` blocks in the test are treated according to the usual rules: those reached
before the exception is raised capture output as usual, and those that "would have" been
reached after are marked as unreachable:

<!-- $MDX file=./test/negative-tests/for-mdx/mdx_cases.ml,part=exn -->
```ocaml
let%expect_test "exception" =
  Printexc.record_backtrace false;
  printf "start!";
  [%expect {| |}];
  let sum = 2 + 2 in
  if sum <> 3
  then (
    printf "%d" sum;
    failwith "nope");
  printf "done!";
  [%expect {| done! |}]
;;
```

becomes:

<!-- $MDX file=./test/negative-tests/for-mdx/mdx_cases.ml.corrected.expected,part=exn -->
```ocaml
let%expect_test "exception" =
  Printexc.record_backtrace false;
  printf "start!";
  [%expect {| start! |}];
  let sum = 2 + 2 in
  if sum <> 3
  then (
    printf "%d" sum;
    failwith "nope");
  printf "done!";
  [%expect.unreachable]
[@@expect.uncaught_exn
  {|
  (Failure nope)
  Trailing output
  ---------------
  4
  |}]
;;
```

Unlike `[%expect]` blocks, which might be reached on some runs of a test and not others, a
test with an `[@@expect.uncaught_exn]` attribute _must_ raise every time it is run.
Changing the `None` branch of the functorized test from [before](#unreached-expects) to
raise gives:

<!-- $MDX file=./test/negative-tests/for-mdx/mdx_cases.ml.corrected.expected,part=sometimes-raises -->
```ocaml
module Test' (B : sig
    val interesting_opt : int option
  end) =
struct
  let%expect_test "sometimes raises" =
    match B.interesting_opt with
    | Some x ->
      printf "%d\n" x;
      [%expect {| 5 |}]
    | None -> failwith "got none!"
  [@@expect.uncaught_exn
    {|
    (* expect_test: Test ran multiple times with different uncaught exceptions *)
    =============================== Output 1 / 3 ================================
    <expect test ran without uncaught exception>
    =============================== Output 2 / 3 ================================
    (Failure "got none!")
    =============================== Output 3 / 3 ================================
    <expect test ran without uncaught exception>
    |}]
  ;;
end

module _ = Test' (struct
    let interesting_opt = Some 5
  end)

module _ = Test' (struct
    let interesting_opt = None
  end)

module _ = Test' (struct
    let interesting_opt = Some 5
  end)
```


# Output capture

The extension point `[%expect.output]` evaluates to a `string` with the output that would
have been captured had an `[%expect]` node been there instead.

One idiom for testing non-deterministic output is to capture the output using
`[%expect.output]` and post-process it:

<!-- $MDX file=./test/negative-tests/for-mdx/mdx_cases.ml.corrected.expected,part=output-capture -->
```ocaml
(* Suppose we want to test code that attaches a timestamp to everything it prints *)
let print_message s = printf "%s: %s\n" (Time_float.to_string_utc (Time_float.now ())) s

let%expect_test "output capture" =
  (* A simple way to clean up the non-determinism is to 'X' all digits *)
  let censor_digits s = String.map s ~f:(fun c -> if Char.is_digit c then 'X' else c) in
  print_message "Hello";
  [%expect.output] |> censor_digits |> print_endline;
  [%expect {| XXXX-XX-XX XX:XX:XX.XXXXXXZ: Hello |}];
  print_message "world";
  [%expect.output] |> censor_digits |> print_endline;
  [%expect {| XXXX-XX-XX XX:XX:XX.XXXXXXZ: world |}]
;;
```

Other uses of `[%expect.output]` include:

* Sorting lines of output printed in nondeterministic order.
* Passing output that is known to be a sexp to `t_of_sexp` and performing tests on the
  resulting structure.
* Performing some sort of additional validation on the output before printing it to a
  normal `[%expect]` block.

# Configuration

Expect-test exposes hooks for configuring how the bodies of expect tests are run, which
can be used to set up and tear down test environments, sanitize output, or embed
`[%expect]` expressions in a monadic computation, like a `Deferred.t`.

Each `let%expect_test` reads these configurations from the module named
`Expect_test_config` in the scope of that let binding. The default module in scope defines
no-op hooks that the user can override. To do so, first include the existing
`Expect_test_config`, then override a subset of the following interface:

```ocaml
module type Expect_test_config = sig
  (** The type of the expression on the RHS of a [let%expect_test]
      binding is [unit IO.t] *)
  module IO : sig
      type 'a t

      val return : 'a -> 'a t
  end

  (** Run an IO operation until completion *)
  val run : (unit -> unit IO.t) -> unit

  (** [sanitize] can be used to map all output strings, e.g. for cleansing. *)
  val sanitize : string -> string

  (** This module type actually contains other definitions, but they
      are for internal testing of [ppx_expect] only. *)
end
```

For example, `Async` exports an `Expect_test_config` equivalent to:

```ocaml skip
module Expect_test_config = struct
  include Expect_test_config

  module IO = Async_kernel.Deferred

  let run f = Async_unix.Thread_safe.block_on_async_exn f
end
```

If we want to consistently apply the same sanitization to all of the output in our expect
test, like we did in the timestamp example above, we can override
`Expect_test_config.sanitize`. This cleans up the testing code and removes the need to use
`[%expect.output]`.

<!-- $MDX file=./test/negative-tests/for-mdx/mdx_cases.ml.corrected.expected,part=sanitization -->
```ocaml
(* Suppose we want to test code that attaches a timestamp to everything it prints *)
let print_message s = printf "%s: %s\n" (Time_float.to_string_utc (Time_float.now ())) s

module Expect_test_config = struct
  include Expect_test_config

  (* A simple way to clean up the non-determinism is to 'X' all digits *)
  let sanitize s = String.map s ~f:(fun c -> if Char.is_digit c then 'X' else c)
end

let%expect_test "sanitization" =
  print_message "Hello";
  [%expect {| XXXX-XX-XX XX:XX:XX.XXXXXXZ: Hello |}];
  print_message "world";
  [%expect {| XXXX-XX-XX XX:XX:XX.XXXXXXZ: world |}]
;;
```


# Build system integration

Follow the same rules as for
[ppx_inline_test](https://github.com/janestreet/ppx_inline_test). Just make sure to
include `ppx_expect.evaluator` as a dependency of the test runner. The [Jane Street
tests](https://github.com/janestreet/jane-street-tests) contains a few working examples
using oasis.

[^1]: By ensuring that, for multiline output, the string delimiters lie on their own lines
    (and are not mixed with the test contents), we make it so conflict markers from
    conflicts in test output lie entirely inside the string literal. Then the file still
    builds after the rebase, and the conflict can be resolved just by building the test
    and accepting the corrections.
